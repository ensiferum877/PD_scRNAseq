# üîç Automated Metadata Discovery and Analysis Framework with AI-Driven Contextualization

**Framework Overview**
This repository presents a comprehensive framework for automated discovery, acquisition, and analysis of publicly available genomic data. The system combines programmatic data extraction,
and AI-driven metadata analysis to facilitate systematic data mining and interpretation.

**Core Framework Components**

- Programmatic Data Extraction

Automated interaction with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using Biopython
Systematic querying based on customizable search criteria
Metadata and dataset downloading capabilities


- AI-Driven Metadata Analysis

Integration with Llama 3.2 via Ollama for intelligent data labeling
Automated classification and contextualization of experimental metadata
Enhanced dataset relevance assessment

# Demonstration: Application to Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Research

This repository demonstrates an automated approach to identifying, acquiring, and analyzing specific types of publicly available genomic data to support biomarker discovery for Parkinson's Disease (PD). The advancement of precision medicine in Parkinson's Disease (PD) requires easily accessible biomarkers from minimally invasive sources. We therefore hypothesized that Blood-based single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) data holds particular promise for this purpose. Since we don't possess any sort of similar type of experimental data, we screened public repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to understand whether such data is actually available in public repositories.


# Technical Requirements
Note: This implementation requires Ollama installation. Detailed installation instructions and Docker configuration are provided in separate documentation.
